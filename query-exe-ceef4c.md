Query.exe is a legitimate executable file associated with Microsoft Windows, specifically tied to version 10.0.15063.0, and is part of the operating system's functionality, primarily used for querying data and system resources. As a Microsoft-published component, it is generally considered safe to run and does not pose a risk of being malware or a virus. However, users may encounter errors related to query.exe if there are issues with system files, corrupted installations, or conflicts with other software, which can lead to performance problems or unexpected behavior. It's essential for users to ensure their systems are updated and to run antivirus scans periodically to maintain security and functionality, as malicious software can sometimes disguise itself with similar filenames.
